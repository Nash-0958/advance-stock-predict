# advance-stock-predict
This Python script performs stock price change prediction using machine learning and time series analysis. It preprocesses stock data, trains a Random Forest model for regression, and uses an LSTM neural network to forecast stock price changes for the next 10 days. The results are visualized with various plots and saved to a CSV file.
